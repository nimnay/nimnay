Hi! I'm a Computer Science student at **Clemson University**, minoring in **Artificial Intelligence**.  
At heart, I’m a creator who loves both math and art — computer science lets me live in both worlds: the logic and precision of math paired with the creativity of design.  
I’m driven by the idea of building things that are both **functional and beautiful**.

## About Me
I’m passionate about building intelligent systems that combine creativity with computation.  
Most of my work lies at the intersection of **AI**, **cloud infrastructure**, and **human-centered software design**.  
I’ve explored topics like scalable AI pipelines, retrieval-augmented systems, and cloud-based model deployment — often experimenting with tools from **NVIDIA** and **AWS** to bring ideas to life.

I enjoy projects that challenge me to think deeply about both architecture and usability — how technology can be engineered not just to work efficiently, but to serve people meaningfully.

## Featured Project
### [My AI Advisor](https://github.com/nimnay/AIAdvisor)
An intelligent course scheduling assistant built for **CUHackit 2025**.  
My AI Advisor helps students plan academic schedules by analyzing completed courses, prerequisites, and time constraints.

**Highlights**
- Generates conflict-free, personalized class schedules  
- Validates prerequisites and co-requisites  
- Uses **Claude 3 Sonnet (AWS Bedrock)** for intelligent reasoning  
- Designed for scalability and real-world integration  

## Technical Interests
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning  
- Distributed and Cloud Systems  
- Intelligent System Design  
- Product Development that blends logic with creativity

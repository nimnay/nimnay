### Hello there! 
I'm a Computer Science student at **Clemson University**, minoring in **Artificial Intelligence**.  
At heart, I’m a creator who loves both math and art, Computer science lets me live in both worlds. I’m driven by the idea of building things that are both **functional and beautiful**.

Most recently, I interned as an AI Engineer Intern at **TD Synnex**, where I built an AI system utilizing **NVIDIA** AI ecosystem.

I enjoy projects that challenge me to think deeply about both architecture and usability, how technology can be engineered not just to work efficiently, but to serve people meaningfully.

### Technical Interests

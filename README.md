# Nimra Nayyar

Hi! I'm a Computer Science student at **Clemson University**, minoring in **Artificial Intelligence**.  
At heart, I’m a creator who loves both math and art — computer science lets me live in both worlds: the logic and precision of math paired with the creativity of design.  
I’m driven by the idea of building things that are both **functional and beautiful**.

## About Me
I’m passionate about designing intelligent systems that combine creativity with computation.  
My recent work explores **AI integration, cloud infrastructure, and scalable software design** using:

- **AWS Bedrock** for deploying and fine-tuning AI models  
- **NVIDIA technologies** for performance and inference optimization  
- **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for containerized cloud applications  
- **Python**, **Next.js**, and **Flask** for end-to-end development  

I enjoy bridging AI, engineering, and design to build meaningful products.

Hi! I'm a Computer Science student at **Clemson University**, minoring in **Artificial Intelligence**.  
At heart, I’m a creator who loves both math and art. Computer science lets me live in both worlds: the logic and precision of math paired with the creativity of design.  
I’m driven by the idea of building things that are both **functional and beautiful**.

### About Me
I’m passionate about building intelligent systems that combine creativity with computation.  
Most of my work lies at the intersection of **AI**, **cloud infrastructure**, and **human-centered software design**.  
I’ve explored topics like scalable AI pipelines, retrieval-augmented systems, and cloud-based model deployment, often experimenting with tools from **NVIDIA** and **AWS** to bring ideas to life.

I enjoy projects that challenge me to think deeply about both architecture and usability, how technology can be engineered not just to work efficiently, but to serve people meaningfully.

### Technical Interests
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning  
- Distributed and Cloud Systems
